# Hospital-Patient-Treatment-and-Recovery-Analysis---Excel-

# Project Overview #
This project focuses on analyzing a hospital dataset using Microsoft Excel to uncover trends in patient treatment,revcovery data using pivot tables, charts, and dashboard to evaluate patient outcomes. The analysis aims to support a data-driven decision-making through a clean, interactive dashboard that summarizes key healthcare metrics.

# Objectives #
Hospitals generate large volumes of data that are often underutilized. This project seeks to analyze raw hospital data and transform them into actionable insights by identifying trends in patient care, treatment type, and recovery rates.

# Dataset Description #
This Hospital Patient Treatment Dataset was gotten from kaggle and contains simulated data representing patient treatments in a multi-specialty hospital. It includes 200 records with both categorical and numerical fields and features 3–4 categorical fields: Department (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics), Treatment Type (Surgery, Medication, Therapy, Observation), Doctor Name, and Gender. It also includes numerical fields such as Age, Treatment Cost, Hospital Stay (Days), and Recovery Score (ranging from 0 to 100).
